# ðŸŽ‰ Sziget Festival Surprise

A fun interactive surprise to reveal an upcoming trip to Sziget Festival! Features 3D fireworks, floating balloons, and a wandering camper van.

## What it does

Click the surprise button to reveal the festival announcement with continuous 3D animations:
- Fireworks blowing up
- Balloons floating 
- A 3D camper van (the exact model I actually own :D) that drives back and forth

## Running it locally

You'll need Node.js installed, then:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173` and click the surprise button!

## Tech used

- React + TypeScript
- Three.js for 3D animations
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Framer Motion for smooth transitions
